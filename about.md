Hello!  We are a group of students with some shared academic interests. Our goal is to spread accessible knowledge for specialized topics in electrical engineering and to support research project development. We will host weekly discussions, have ongoing research projects, and attend conferences.
Anyone is welcome to join and attend meetings.
