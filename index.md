Hello! We are a group of students with interest in computational intelligence advised by Professor Helen Yu of the electrical engineering department at Cal Poly. Our goal is to spread accessible knowledge for computational intelligence and to support research project development. We will endeavor to host weekly discussions, have ongoing research projects, and attend conferences.

Any questions can be directed to [calpoly.ieee.cis@gmail.com](mailto:calpoly.ieee.cis@gmail.com).

See the other tabs for more information.
