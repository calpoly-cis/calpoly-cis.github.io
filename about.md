Hello! We are a group of students interested in forming student chapters of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Computational Intelligence Society (CIS), Control Systems Society (CSS), and Communications Society (ComSoc).
Our goal is to spread accessible knowledge for some more specialized topics in electrical engineering and to support research project development.
Anyone is welcome to join the societies that we support.
